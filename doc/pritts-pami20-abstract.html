This paper introduces minimal solvers that jointly solve for radial
lens undistortion and affine-rectification using local features
extracted from the image of coplanar translated and reflected scene
texture, which is common in man-made environments. The proposed
solvers accommodate different types of local features and sampling
strategies, and three of the proposed variants require just one
feature correspondence. State-of-the-art techniques from algebraic
geometry are used to simplify the formulation of the solvers. The
generated solvers are stable, small and fast. Synthetic and real-image
experiments show that the proposed solvers have superior robustness to
noise compared to the state of the art. The solvers are integrated
with an automated system for rectifying imaged scene planes from
coplanar repeated texture. Accurate rectifications on challenging
imagery taken with narrow to wide field-of-view lenses demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed solvers.y

This paper proposes minimal solvers that use combinations of imaged
translational symmetries and parallel scene lines to jointly estimate
lens undistortion with either affine rectification or focal length and
absolute orientation. We use constraints provided by orthogonal scene
planes to recover the focal length. We show that solvers using feature
combinations can recover more accurate calibrations than solvers using
only one feature type on scenes that have a balance of lines and
texture. We also show that the proposed solvers are complementary and
can be used together in a RANSAC-based estimator to improve
auto-calibration accuracy. State-of-the-art performance is
demonstrated on a standard dataset of lens-distorted urban images.

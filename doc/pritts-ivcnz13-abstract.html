This paper investigates the plausibility of using approximate models
for hypothesis generation in a RANSAC framework to accurately and
reliably estimate the fundamental matrix. Two novel fundamental matrix
estimators are introduced that sample two correspondences to generate
affine-fundamental matrices for RANSAC hypotheses. A new RANSAC
framework is presented that uses local optimization to estimate the
fundamental matrix from the consensus correspondence sets of verified
hypotheses, which are approximate models. The proposed estimators are
shown to perform better than other approximate models that have
previously been used in the literature for fundamental matrix
estimation in a rigorous evaluation. In addition the proposed
estimators are over 30 times faster, in terms of models verified, than
the 7-point method, and offer comparable accuracy and repeatability on
a large subset of the test set.

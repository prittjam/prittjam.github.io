This paper introduces the first minimal solvers that jointly estimate
lens distortion and affine rectification from the image of
rigidly-transformed coplanar features.  The solvers work on scenes
without straight lines and, in general, relax strong assumptions about
scene content made by the state of the art. The proposed solvers use
the affine invariant that coplanar repeats have the same scale in
rectified space. The solvers are separated into two groups that differ
by how the equal scale invariant of rectified space is used to place
constraints on the lens undistortion and rectification parameters. We
demonstrate a principled approach for generating stable minimal
solvers by the Gr√∂bner basis method, which is accomplished by sampling
feasible monomial bases to maximize numerical stability. Synthetic and
real-image experiments confirm that the proposed solvers demonstrate
superior robustness to noise compared to the state of the
art. Accurate rectifications on imagery taken with narrow to fisheye
field-of-view lenses demonstrate the wide applicability of the
proposed method. The method is fully automatic.

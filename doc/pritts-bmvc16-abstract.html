This paper proposes an automated method to detect, group and rectify
arbitrarily-arranged coplanar repeats via energy minimization. The
proposed energy functional combines several features reflecting how
planes with repeated elements are built and projected into images. The
scene is modeled globally, so discriminating interactions between
different coplanar repeat groups and scene planes can be captured. An
inference framework based on a recent variant of alpha expansion is
described and fast convergence is demonstrated. The proposed method is
evaluated using a new dataset of annotated images containing coplanar
repeats in diverse arrangements. The dataset will be made publicly
available. A significant improvement in rectifications estimated from
detected coplanar repeats is reported with respect to two widely used
geometric multi-model fitting methods.

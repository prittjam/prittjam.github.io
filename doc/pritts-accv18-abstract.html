This paper introduces the first minimal solvers that jointly estimate
lens distortion and affine rectification from repetitions of
rigidly-transformed coplanar local features. The proposed solvers
incorporate lens distortion into the camera model and extend accurate
rectification to wide-angle images that contain nearly any type of
coplanar repeated content. We demonstrate a principled approach to
generating stable minimal solvers by the Gr√∂bner basis method, which
is accomplished by sampling feasible monomial bases to maximize
numerical stability. Synthetic and real-image experiments confirm that
the solvers give accurate rectifications from noisy measurements if
used in a RANSAC-based estimator. The proposed solvers demonstrate
superior robustness to noise compared to the state of the art. The
solvers work on scenes without straight lines and, in general, relax
strong assumptions about scene content made by the state of the
art. Accurate rectifications on imagery taken with narrow focal length
to fisheye lenses demonstrate the wide applicability of the proposed
method.

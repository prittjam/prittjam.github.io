This paper presents a novel and general method for the detection,
rectification and segmentation of imaged coplanar repeated
patterns. The only assumption made of the scene geometry is that
repeated scene elements are mapped to each other by planar Euclidean
transformations. The class of patterns covered is broad and includes
nearly all commonly seen, planar, man-made repeated patterns. In
addition, novel linear constraints are used to reduce geometric
ambiguity between the rectified imaged pattern and the scene
pattern. Rectification to within a similarity of the scene plane is
achieved from one rotated repeat, or to within a similarity with a
scale ambiguity along the axis of symmetry from one reflected
repeat. A stratum of constraints is derived that gives the necessary
configuration of repeats for each successive level of rectification. A
generative model for the imaged pattern is inferred and used to
segment the pattern with pixel accuracy. Qualitative results are shown
on a broad range of image types on which state-of-the-art methods
fail.
